# Online-Voting-System using Java

An online student council voting system is a web-based application that allows students to cast their votes electronically for the student council elections. This system replaces the traditional paper-based voting system and makes the process more efficient and accessible.

The system is designed to be user-friendly and secure. Students are required to log in to the system using their unique credentials (e.g., student ID number and password) to access the ballot. The ballot will contain the names of the candidates running for various positions in the student council, along with their profiles and manifestos.
Once a student has selected their preferred candidate(s), they can submit their vote electronically. The system will automatically tally the votes and generate the results of the election.
Overall, the online student council voting system is a modern and efficient way to conduct student council elections. It streamlines the voting process, reduces errors, and increases accessibility, while also providing the necessary security measures to ensure a fair and transparent election.
